**Please read this brief introduction to R Markdown, and complete the second
half of the document yourself.**

# R Markdown
R Markdown, `.Rmd` files, are a type of markdown files that can execute R code
in an R environment. Markdown is an open source language used for easily
creating documents such as web pages and PDFs. Markdown and R Markdown can be
used to procedurally generate documents and reports, which have a wide number
of use-cases across bioinformatics. Not only can you save time by creating code
to automatically draft documents, you can also include detailed instructions
and information alongside your code.

## knitr
`knitr` is simply the package R uses to convert the R Markdown into the
appropriate output (HTML, PDF, or Word). While there is a deep level of
customization available, most users can comfortably create beautiful documents
with the default parameters. In order to compile your markdown, in RStudio you
can select the `Knit` button below the open file button.

## Markdown Basics
The raw markdown, which you may or may not be looking at, is styled very
basically. The largest titles start with one octothorpe `#`. The more `#`'s
added, the smaller a title or header becomes.  

# Biggest  
## 2nd Biggest  
### so on  
#### and so forth  
##### until you have  
###### six octothorpes  
####### then nothing happens.

Importantly, two spaces (`  `) can be included after a line of text to start a
new line.

Markdown can be styled a few different ways:  
`_italics_` -> _italics_  
`**bold**` -> **bold**  
`` `monospace` `` -> `monospace`, good for code

## R Code in Markdown

The really vital part of R Markdown is the inclusion of code snippets you can
place into the document, which will run and print out to users. In this snippet
I create a function that says hello and that text is printed inside the
document.
```{r}
say_hi <- function() {
  return("Hello world.")
}
print(say_hi())
```

The syntax of the **snippet* is simple, with three back ticks ` ``` `
indicating the start and end of the snippet, and a lower case `r` in curly
braces `{}` to indicate what language is used: `{r}` indicates R, `{python}`
indicates Python. R Markdown does not support every language, but there are use
cases where one document running both R and Python code can prove extremely
useful and concise. There is also a button in RStudio to insert a snippet, it
is a small green `+C` in the top right of the editor.

```{python}
import datetime
print(f'Wishing you a wonderful hello from Python at {datetime.datetime.now()}')
```

I can also test my code in RStudio without having to knit the entire document
by pressing the green "Play" arrow on the snippet I am interested in.

Finally, R Markdown scripts can `source()` other `.R` scripts and use them in
their execution environment. This mean I can define a function in my `main.R`
script and use it in my R Markdown snippets. Note that the converse is true,
using `knitr::purl()`, and the code established in an R Markdown can be
sourced, and _tested_, using an normal `.R` script.

Also note that the environment is carried from one snippet to another, so if I
define a function or load a file in one snippet I can use those objects in
later snippets. 

```{r}
message <- 'The last example...for now.'
```

```{r}
print(paste(message, 'But there\'s always room for more.'))
```


# Assignment
Using what you know from this document and the `main.R` script, use the
functions from `main.R` to draw a boxplot of  expression levels. Use this R
Markdown document to describe your code as you are using it in this document,
as done above. Take time to enhance your ggplot function from the `main.R`
script with high quality visual aesthetics. Do not use default ggplot colors.

<!-- TODO: Add a figure -->
```{r}
# use source to load your functions from main.R into this document.
source("main.R")
```
```{r}
result_tib <- load_expression("/project/bf528/project_1/data/example_intensity_data.csv")
```
